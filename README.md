# EHT_Asia_Simulation_Imaging

1. We consider an array consisting of 11 existing EHT stations and 4 new stations (SPART, KVN Yonsei, SG and AMT), a total of 15 stations located at 13 sites. But the simulated observations are only conducted in the time interval that the SG site can cover. The following array files, model files and pipelines are modified based on the software of EHT-imaging (https://github.com/achael/eht-imaging).

2. Folder "arrays_new_version_more_sites" contains the arrays.

3. Folder "models" contains the model images of Sgr A* and M87.

4. Folder "Pipeline_2022/Sgr" contains the python pipelines for generating synthetic data and reconstructing images of Sgr A*.

5. Folder "Pipeline_2022/M87" contains the python pipelines for generating synthetic data and reconstructing images of M87.
